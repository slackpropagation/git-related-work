# D197 - Version Control Project (WGU)

This repository contains my completed work for the D197 Version Control project at Western Governors University (WGU).

## Project Summary

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate fundamental skills in version control using Git and GitLab. This includes creating branches, resolving merge conflicts, tagging versions, and documenting project history through logs and summaries.

## Key Components

- Branch management (`main`, `Test`, `Working`)
- Merge conflict creation and resolution
- Tagging with semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Retrospective directory with:
  - `log.txt`: full git commit log
  - `summary.txt`: merge conflict summary and task breakdown
  - Final documentation file with screenshots and comments

## Tools Used

- Git (CLI)
- GitLab (Web Interface)
- Nano (File editor)
- Bash (Terminal on macOS)
- GitHub CLI (optional)

## What I Learned

- Practical branching and merging workflows
- Conflict resolution via CLI
- Use of `git log`, `git tag`, and redirect operators
- Pushing changes to remote repositories
- Documentation and project tracking with Git
