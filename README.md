# Repository Overview

This repository contains my hands-on practice and project work in version control using Git and GitLab.  
It is focused on demonstrating foundational version control skills essential for professional software development, including branch management, conflict resolution, tagging, project history analysis, and documentation.  
Through these projects and exercises, I strengthened my ability to use Git effectively both through the command line and GitLabâ€™s web interface, preparing for real-world development workflows.
